
There are two ways of installing, the basic install contains all the routes and voices.
The advanced installation method allows you to select which routes you want to install.
Installing only one route reduces the install size from 130MB to 75MB~100MB.

Basic Installation
1. Copy the contents of "base_install" to /vnds/novels/fate on your flashcard.
2. Optional. Overwrite the script.zip and info.txt on the DS with the ones in "patch-ja" to play the game in Japanese.
3. Run with vnds.nds (http://www.digital-haze.net/vnds.php)
